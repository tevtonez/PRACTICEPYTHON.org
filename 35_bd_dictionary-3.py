TASK 33 from http://www.practicepython.org/
----------------------------------------

This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series.

In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. In this exercise,
load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many people have a birthday
in each month.

Your program should output something like:

{
    "May": 3,
    "November": 2,
    "December": 1
}
